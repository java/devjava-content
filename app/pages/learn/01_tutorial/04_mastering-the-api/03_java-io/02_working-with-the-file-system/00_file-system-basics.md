This part of the tutorial covers all the interactions with the file system. It includes file manipulation with the [`File`](javadoc:File) class and the [`Path`](javadoc:Path) interface, and directory creation. It shows you how to access file metadata, depending on the file system you are working with. It presents the patterns to explore the content of a directory tree using a visitor pattern, and how to monitor a directory for file creation and deletion events.
