Lambda expressions were a powerful addition to the Java language starting in Java 8. This is a series of tutorials aimed at introducing the concept of lambdas while incrementally teaching how to use them in practice as you progress through each tutorial.

The tutorials in this series are listed below. We recommend starting with the first and working your way through, but you are free to start wherever you'd like!
