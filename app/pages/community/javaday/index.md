Oracle's Java Developer Relations Team is excited to re-introduce Java Day. By partnering with a local Java User Group (JUG) near you, you'll have the opportunity to hear from Oracle's Java experts to evolve and advance your programming skills.

If you're a JUG leader/organizer, please send us an e-mail to request a Java Day event. If travel schedules align, we'll bring Java Day to one of your future in-person JUG meet-ups with experts and giveaways. Make your request [by sending an e-mail](mailto:java_devrel_events_grp@oracle.com).
