The Java Champions Program consists of a unique group of skilled Java technologists and community leaders. Java Champions come from a broad cross-section of the Java community. They are leaders, influencers and enablers who help grow the size of the Java community. Java Champions are active in many ways such as actively participating in Java projects,  engaging with Java User Group communities, speaking at conferences, authoring content, teaching other developers, fostering inclusive participation and so much more.

They are technical and community luminaries; some are Java engineers or architects who are relatively skilled and have lots of experience, or are community builders who take time to build personal, long-lasting relationships that go beyond programming. Java Champions are independent-minded and credible, who embody the best virtues of the Java community including honesty, dedication and sincerity.

Java Champions are also able to advocate or influence other developers through their own professional activities (via consulting, teaching, writing, speaking, etc.). They have the opportunity to provide independent, constructive feedback and ideas absent of a competitive agenda that will help Oracle continue to move Java forward. This interchange may be in the form of technical discussions and/or community-building activities with Oracle's Java Advocacy Team.
