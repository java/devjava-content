Like the world around us, the Java Platform is continually moving forward. New paradigms arise like machine learning, deployment models like cloud computing become commonplace, developer fashions ebb and flow, and hardware accelerates and evolves. It is important that you can trust your chosen programming platform to address these changes in a thoughtful way that respects the past, lives up to its promises, and adheres to a set of guiding principles. Innovation is critical, but not at the expense of predictability and productivity.
