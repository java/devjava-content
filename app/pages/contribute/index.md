You, too, can help shape the future of the world's most popular programming platform used by millions of developers globally! From spreading the word about popular new features to becoming a committer to [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/), to joining the [Java in Education](https://jcp.org/java-in-education) initiative, this section highlights some of the areas in which you can help out.


## Testing Things Out

Contributing to Java is not just about creating a new API. We're looking for people to test out early-access builds, impermanent features, innovation projects like Loom and Panama, testing 3rd-party libraries, and more.
