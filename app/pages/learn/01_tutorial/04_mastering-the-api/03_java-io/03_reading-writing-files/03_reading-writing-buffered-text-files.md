The [`java.nio.file`](javadoc:java.nio.file) package supports channel I/O, which moves data in buffers, bypassing some of the layers that can bottleneck stream I/O.

## Understanding the Character Handling

The Java platform stores character values using Unicode conventions. Character stream I/O automatically translates this internal format to and from the local character set. In Western locales, the local character set is usually an 8-bit superset of ASCII or UTF-8.

Input and output done with stream classes automatically translates to and from the local character set. Until Java SE 17, a program that uses character streams automatically adapts to the local character set and is ready for internationalization â€” all without extra effort by the programmer. Starting with Java SE 18, the default charset of your Java application is UTF-8.

If internationalization is not a priority, you can simply use the character stream classes without paying much attention to character set issues. Later, if internationalization becomes a priority, your program can be adapted without extensive recoding.

## Reading a Text File by Using Buffered Stream I/O

The [`newBufferedReader(Path, Charset)`](javadoc:Files.newBufferedReader(CharSet)) method opens a file for reading, returning a [`BufferedReader`](javadoc:BufferedReader) that can be used to read text from a file in an efficient manner.

The `BufferedReader` class gives you a method to read the content of your text file line by line. Starting with Java SE 8, it also gives you a method to create a `Stream<String>` on the lines of your text file. You can learn more about streams in the [Stream Section](id:api.stream) of this tutorial.

The following code reads your file line by line.

```java
// The closing of the reader and the handling of the exceptions
// have been omitted
// String line = reader.readLine();
long count = 0L;
while (line != null) {
    count++;
    line = reader.readLine();
}
System.out.println("Number of lines in this file = " + count);
```

Note that the `line` string does not contain the line termination characters of each line. When the end of the file is reached, the line returned is `null`.

Starting with Java SE 8, you can write the following code.

```java
Path path = Path.of("file.txt");

try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path);
     Stream<String> lines = reader.lines();) {

    long count = lines.count();
    System.out.println("count = " + count);
}
```

The `reader.lines()` method is defined in the `BufferedReader` class. Because the `Stream` interface extends the `AutoCloseable` interface, you can open your stream in a _try-with-resources_ statement. In that case, the `reader` is properly closed.

## Writing a Text File by Using Buffered Stream I/O

You can use the [`newBufferedWriter(Path, Charset, OpenOption...)`](javadoc:Files.newBufferedWriter(OpenOptions)) method to write to a file using a [`BufferedWriter`](javadoc:BufferedWriter).

The following code snippet shows how to create a file encoded in "US-ASCII" using this method:

```java
Charset charset = Charset.forName("US-ASCII");
String s = ...;
try (BufferedWriter writer = Files.newBufferedWriter(file, charset)) {
    writer.write(s, 0, s.length());
} catch (IOException x) {
    System.err.format("IOException: %s%n", x);
}
```
