Participating in a Java User Group is a great way to connect, communicate and collaborate with your developer peers. JUGs can be found on almost every continent with regularly occuring meet-ups.

Java User Groups (JUGs) are volunteer organizations that strive to distribute Java-related knowledge around the world. They provide a meeting place for Java users to get information, share resources and solutions, increase networking, expand Java Technology expertise, and above all, strive to build a more inclusive community. JUGs are the meeting point for the Java community to connect, communicate and collaborate with developer peers. Explore the list of JUGs globally that you can become active in.

You can discover the world of JUGs socially on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/i/lists/221697230/members
